<p>Congratulations, you've deployed your own version of the Memcache test app to Heroku.</p>

<p>Your app's name is <b><%= request.subdomain %></b>. You will need this name when connecting to Heroku.</p>

<p>To establish a shell for interacting with Memcache run the following from the command line or terminal:</p>

<code><pre>
$ heroku run console -a <%= request.subdomain %>
irb> cache = Dalli::Client.new
irb> cache.set("foo", "bar")
=> true
irb> cache.get("foo")
=> "bar"
</pre></code>
